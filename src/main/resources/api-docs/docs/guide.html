    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <p>WSO2 Identity Server is an identity and entitlement management server that facilitates security while connecting and managing multiple identities across different applications. It enables enterprise architects and developers to improve customer experience through a secure single sign-on environment.The multi-tenant WSO2 Identity Server, can be deployed directly on servers or in the cloud, and has the ability to propagate identities across geographical and enterprise borders in a connected business environment.</p>

    <p> The REST API is implemented based on REST best practices and specifications as a CXF REST web application running on WSO2 Identity Server. API development is started with a swagger specification with a contract-first approach.The API comes with a pluggable security mechanism. Since API security is implemented as a CXF handler, if you need to plug a custom security mechanism, you can write your own handler and add it to the web service.
